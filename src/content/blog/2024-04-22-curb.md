let me ask a question

when somebody are very starving, then they need food?

right?

so they booked a dinner, but the host told them xx is not available.

general: ppl go to xx is for xx, why cant it be available

Exaggerate: then ppl went to where to find a eat?

I tell you--> example: 

expression--> its very horrible, is it right?

self protection, selfish, not really care what happened to others, fixable to make apology to make others 
feel better, then he could get what he wants.
