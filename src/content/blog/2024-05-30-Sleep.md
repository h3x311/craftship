  - Do weights.
  - Do stretches.
  - Do jump rope exercises.
- Limit to two cups of green tea:
  - In the early morning.
  - Before noon.
- No use of digital devices or bright light in the room once the sun goes down.
- Install Twilight on my phone.
- Take a shower approximately two hours before bed (after dinner).
